**Vault** is a permissions, chat, & economy API to give plugins easy hooks into.

This is, of course, an updated fork of the original **[Vault](https://github.com/milkbowl/Vault)** project.

All credit for the original project goes to the **[MilkBowl](https://github.com/MilkBowl)** team.

## Overview

I created this fork due to Vault not receiving an update in over **3 years**.

This fork aims to update the entire codebase with the focus of maintainability.

## Features

- All the features of the original Vault project *(version 1.7.3)*
- Re-coded the entire project to be more efficient and easier to maintain
- Merged the VaultAPI into the project itself
- Removed Vault's update checker and need for config files
- Updated to natively support newer versions of Minecraft
- Removed all built-in support for old permissions and chat plugins
- Moved existing commands under the `/vault` command and revised them
- Lombok has been implemented to reduce boilerplate code
- Migrated from using Maven to Gradle
